;;; This file contains an implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev
;;; algorithm described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0505030.pdf,
;;; used to approximately decompose arbitrary unitaries using a finite
;;; set of basis gates.

;;; In the rest of this file, d(x, y) refers to the function of
;;; operator distance defined in the above paper and is equal to ||X -
;;; Y||, the operator norm of (X - Y).

;;; C-approx should theoretically be approximately equal to (* 8 +c-gc+),
;;; but as the paper's authors have shown, a c-approx as low as 2.67

It is also assumed that d(V, I) = d(W, I) < c-gc * sqrt(eps), which is true for group commutator decompositions made inside the SK-algorithm.")

;;; The general procedure here is to use what I call the "angle-axis
;;; ball" mapping of SU(2) (technically PU(2), the group of SU(2)
;;; modulo global phase). A unitary which is a rotation about an axis
;;; in 3d space by an angle theta is mapped to a point of radius theta
;;; in the direction of the rotation axis; thus, the entire group is
;;; mapped to a ball of radius pi. Then, dividing up the ball into a
;;; grid of a certain spacing, we can store one sequence per grid
;;; section and ensure that the entire ball is covered by these grid
;;; representatives.

;;; The Euclidean distance between points in the angle-axis ball is
;;; not perfectly correlated with our desired metric of operator
;;; distance, but is related closely enough to serve as a surprisingly
;;; good heuristic. It is also much more convenient to work with than
;;; a 3-sphere, which is a big reason for why I'm using this.
